            <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              Many people want the benefits of living in a single family home.
              However, whether they're a first-time homebuyer who's cautious
              about making such a large financial investment, someone who has
              recently relocated and is unsure of which neighborhood to live in,
              or someone who is creditworthy but cannot currently obtain a
              mortgage, they hope to one day buy a home but aren't ready now.
