            <p className="mb-5">
              The initial term of the Lease is generally one year, and the Lease
              automatically renews every year as long as the resident is in
              compliance with the Lease and Right to Purchase Agreement. Each
              year, the resident has the right to give notice that he/she does
              not want to renew the Lease for another year. If for any reason
              the resident decides to leave the home at the end of a Lease term
              and is in compliance with the Lease, the full security deposit
              will be returned.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-5">
              The resident's financial commitment is limited to the initial term
              of the Lease. The resident does not have to renew the Lease after
              the initial term. The maximum number of years of the Lease is five
              in most states and three in Texas.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-5">
              Over the life of the Lease, subject to applicable laws, Home
              Partners expects residents to treat the home as their own,
              maintain the lawn and garden, remove snow or debris, and complete
              minor repairs.

              The resident's Right to Purchase Agreement (and therefore Right to
              Purchase) is in effect as long as the Lease is in effect, and the
              resident is in compliance with these two agreements.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-5">
              The Right to Purchase Agreement gives the resident the right to
              purchase the home from Home Partners at a pre-defined price for
              each year of the Lease, as long as the resident is in compliance
              with the Lease and the Right to Purchase Agreements. The maximum
              number of years a resident can rent the home and have the Right to
              Purchase is five years in most states and three years in Texas.
              The Right to Purchase does not obligate the resident to buy the
              home.

              What personal information we collect
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-5">
              The purchase price in your Right to Purchase, as set at the time
              you enter into the lease, will include an adjustment equal to
              $2,500 (a “Maintenance Adjustment”). If you choose to purchase the
              home, and the maintenance costs covered by the Maintenance
              Adjustment actually incurred by Home Partners during the lease are
              less than the Maintenance Adjustment, the purchase price of the
              home at closing will be reduced by the unused amount of the
              Maintenance Adjustment.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-5">
              The Maintenance Adjustment generally may be used to cover the cost
              of any repairs, renovations, replacements or improvements to the
              home that Home Partners determines are necessary or appropriate
              during your lease term. Examples of the costs for which the
              Maintenance Adjustment may be used include the replacement of a
              major mechanical system (e.g., HVAC, furnace, roofing) or the
              repair of appliances, plumbing or fixtures. Home Partners
              generally is responsible for costs of home repairs in excess of
              the Maintenance Adjustment and those excess costs will not
              increase the purchase price for the home.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-5">
              However, the Maintenance Adjustment does not limit your
              responsibility for any costs for which you would be responsible
              under the terms of the lease. Examples of these costs are costs
              due to your misuse of the home, your willful or negligent conduct,
              or your failure to comply with the lease. Home Partners may
              require you to pay these other costs separately in accordance with
              the terms of your lease.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-5">
              Your rent is not affected by the Maintenance Adjustment, and the
              Maintenance Adjustment does not affect you unless you purchase the
              home. For example, if Home Partners pays repair costs of $2,500
              during the lease term that are covered by the Maintenance
              Adjustment, and you choose not to buy the home, you will not be
              required to reimburse Home Partners for those amounts.
